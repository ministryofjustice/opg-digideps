#Adding Report Sections
Test
Complete the Deputy Report service comprises a number of sections of a larger form that deputies use to report on how they have carried out their deputyship details over a 12-month period. In code, this is modelled on the `Report` entity with each subsection defined as separate entities and linked to the report in one-to-one relationships.

In order to add a new section to the report carry out the following steps:

##API
* Decide on a descriptive name for the report section and create a new entity class in `api/src/entity/`
* Add the relevant annotations to signal to Doctrine that the entity class is an entity and should have a corresponding database table:

```phpt
/**
 * @ORM\Table(name="lifestyle")
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Lifestyle
{}
```

* Map the questions included in the form section to properties on the entity class including any required Doctrine notations related to the expected response types. For example, a question asking if a client undertakes social activities could be mapped as follows:

```phpt
    /**
     * @var string yes|no|null
     *
     * @JMS\Type("string")
     * @JMS\Groups({"lifestyle"})
     * @ORM\Column( name="does_client_undertake_social_activities", type="string", length=4, nullable=true)
     */
    private $doesClientUndertakeSocialActivities;
```

* When all questions are mapped to properties, exec in to the api docker container and generate a new migration file using the Symfony console:

```
> docker compose exec api sh

> php app/console doctrine:migrations:diff
```

* Check the contents of the migration file generated to ensure it captures the required database changes and amend if necessary. Rename the migration file following the naming convention in `api/src/Migrations` and, still inside the api docker container, run the migration:

```
> php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

* Inspect the database to ensure the new tables and changes are as expected

* Add a new `SECTION_` constant to the Report entity with the name of the section and add to `Report::getSectionsSettings()` assigning which report types the section should appear in

* Add a getter for the section state to `ReportStatusService` including relevant JMS tags. The name of the getter function will be transformed as the state name when returned from the API:

```phpt
    /**
     * @JMS\VirtualProperty
     * @JMS\Type("array")
     * @JMS\Groups({"status", "lifestyle-state"})
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function getLifestyleState()
    {
        ...
    }
```

becomes:

```phpt
    [lifestyle_state] => [
        [state] => done
        [nOfRecords] => 0
    ]
```

##Client

* Create a representation of the `api` report section entity in `client` including all the properties. Ensure the entity includes the `HasReportTrait` added to it:

```phpt
class Lifestyle
{
    use HasReportTrait;
    ...
}
```

* Add the newly created entity as a property to the `Report` entity:

```phpt
    /**
     * @JMS\Type("App\Entity\Report\Lifestyle")
     *
     * @var Lifestyle|null
     */
    private $lifestyle;
```

* Add a section status property to Report/Status following the same naming convention used in API `ReportStatusService`

* If there are going to be multiple instances of the report section entity associated with the report then add a trait in Entity/Report/Traits to store the entities in an ArrayCollection and define any functions that will interact with the entities collection

* Create a new form class and map the report section entity properties to the form questions as required (see examples in `client/src/Form/Report`)

* Add a new section to the report overview template (`App/Report/Report/overview.html.twig`) by including a new `App/Report/Report/_subsection.html.twig` partial. If required for NDR reports also include in `App/Ndr/Ndr/overview.html.twig`

* Create a corresponding controller and implement the form logic as required using the newly created form type

* Add an entry for the new section \to `ReportSectionsLinkService` and then include the `_nextprevious.html.twig` partial on the first and last page of the section

# Adding new section to report checklist

When a deputy submits a report an OPG case manager will read through the responses and complete a checklist on the admin side of the app to confirm if they are satisfied with the deputies responses.

To add the new question to the checklist follow the steps below:

##API
- Add a property to the `Checklist` entity that corresponds to the new section added to the form along with JMS groups and types. The number of properties could either correspond directly with the number of questions in the section, or it could be one property that encompasses all the questions in the section. For example, health and lifestyle has a single response despite multiple questions whereas Money in and money out has three questions the case manager neeeds to answer.
- Generate a migration to add the required new column/s to the `checklist` table

##Client
- Mirror the properties that were added to `Checklist` in the API app ensuring the JMS groups and types match
- Add either relevant validation the property to ensure the form can't be submitted without providing an answer
- Add the new property/properties as children to `ReportChecklistType`
- Create a new partial in `templates/Admin/Client/Report/partials` to render the new option in the form and add it to `checklist.html.twig`. At this point you may need to update the `qid` values for the questions on the checklist (e.g. `L3.1` etc) - seek guidance from the product owner on the numbering.
- Add the new section to the sidebar anchor links in `templates/Admin/Client/Report/sidebar`
- Add translations to `admin-checklist.en.yml` to correspond to the translation values added to the form and template
