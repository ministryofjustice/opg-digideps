## Digideps - Disaster Recovery Plan

#### Resilience & Data Recovery

- 14 day db Snapshot stored on AWS. AWS DB snapshots redundantly stores data in multiple facilities and on multiple devices within each facility. To increase durability, Amazon synchronously stores your data across multiple facilities before confirming that the data has been successfully stored.

- Daily backup of snapshots to separate account in the unlikely event the account were to be compromised. We keep the last 7 days worth of backups there.

- Process to be tested every 6 months - 1 year (or when team make significant changes)

- Database split over availability zones so that it will failover to another zone if current zone goes down

- Redis split over availability zones so that it will failover to another zone if current zone goes down.

- Based on full take up of our digital service, we donâ€™t expect more than 70 users at any given time to be on service in the near future unless there is some significant change in policy or in functionality to the service.

#### Business appetite for time to recovery
- **Caseworker** side - 48 hours

- **Deputy side** - 5 working days
All of our measures to restore the service fall within the 48 hours specified by the business.

#### Instructions to restore from snapshot

1) Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.
2) In the navigation pane, choose Snapshots.
3) Choose the DB cluster snapshot that you want to restore from.
4) For Actions, choose Restore Snapshot.
5) On the Restore DB Instance page, for DB Instance Identifier, enter the name for your restored DB cluster.
6) Choose Restore DB Instance.
