# Complete the deputy report

This app is the [Complete the deputy report][service] service. It provides an online reporting service used by deputies to submit their reports, and the private area for case managers to review submitted reports.

## Requirements

You must have Docker installed.

## Installation

- Add `127.0.0.1 digideps.local admin.digideps.local api.digideps.local www.digideps.local` to `/etc/hosts`
- Navigate to the root directory of this repository and run `make up-app`
- Check `https://digideps.local/` (Deputy area) and `https://admin.digideps.local/` (Admin area). Your browser will warn you about a self-signed certificate.
- Run `./generate_certs.sh` to populate your certs directory

### Reset the database

Recreate DB schema and run migrations:

```shell script
$ make reset-database
```

Wipe DB contents and re-run fixtures:

```shell script
$ make reset-fixtures
```

This diagram can be updated in `traffic_flow_diagram.puml` and then rendered to PNG using `plantuml ./docs/traffic_flow_diagram.puml -o .`.

## Terraform installation

To develop with Terraform, you must have the following installed:

- Docker
- Make
- terraform-docs
- jq
- aws-vault for credentials handling (optional)
- direnv (to set shell exports, see .envrc) (optional)

You can then use the make files in `environment` and `shared` to set up the environment.

```bash
# ensure your environment is setup:
export TF_WORKSPACE=myawesomeenvironment
export TF_VAR_OPG_DOCKER_TAG=mybranch-githash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAEXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=cbeamsglittering
cd environment
make

# alternatively, using aws-vault:
export TF_WORKSPACE=myawesomeenvironment
export TF_VAR_OPG_DOCKER_TAG=mybranch-githash
cd environment
aws-vault exec identity make
```
