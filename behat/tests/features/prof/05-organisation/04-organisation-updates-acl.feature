    # upload PROF updates
    When I go to admin page "/admin/org-csv-upload"
    And I attach the file "behat-prof-org-updates.csv" to "admin_upload_file"

  # Client has different deputy in the same org. Old deputy left org - dont delete client
  Scenario: Professional deputy leaves organisation, clients appointed a new deputy within the same organisation
    #  (deputy number changes, org identifier stays the same, different deputy email of same org)
