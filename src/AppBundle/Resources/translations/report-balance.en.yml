  para1: |
    In the accounts section, we ask you tell us how much was in %client%'s bank accounts
    at the start of your reporting period (the accounts opening balance) and the end (the
    accounts closing balance).
  para2: |
    We take the accounts opening balance, add the incoming payments you've told us about,
    and subtract the outgoing payments. The result is called the report closing balance.
  para3: The report closing balance should be the same as the accounts closing balance.
  para4: |
    The accounts don't balance: the report closing balance is %moreless% than the accounts
    closing balance.
