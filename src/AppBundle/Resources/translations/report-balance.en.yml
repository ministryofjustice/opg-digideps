    In the <a href="%pathToAccounts%">accounts section</a>, we ask you tell us how much was
    in %client%'s bank accounts at the start of your reporting period (the accounts opening
    balance) and the end (the accounts closing balance).
  para2: |
    We take the accounts opening balance, add the incoming payments you've told us about,
    and subtract the outgoing payments. The result is called the report closing balance.
  para3: The report closing balance should be the same as the accounts closing balance.
  para4: |
    The accounts don't balance: the report closing balance is %moreless% than the accounts
    closing balance.
  para5: "To fix this, please check that:"
  listItem1: the figures you entered for opening and closing balances are correct
  listItem2: you've entered all money in, money out, gifts and expenses correctly
