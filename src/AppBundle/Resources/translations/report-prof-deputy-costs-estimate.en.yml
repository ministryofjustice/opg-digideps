    Tell us about the costs that you and other fee earners expect to charge the client during
    the next reporting period (%nextStartDate% - %nextEndDate%).
    You must submit this insert to the SCCO at the end of the next reporting period along with
    your bill of costs. This will help the SCCO understand whether the professional deputy costs
    charged to the client are reasonable and proportionate to the client’s estate and the work done on their behalf.

    OPG will review your estimate for the next reporting period looking at a number of factors,
