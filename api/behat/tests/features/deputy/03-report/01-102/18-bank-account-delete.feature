  @deputy
  Scenario: Remove account with transfers does not delete transactions
    Given I am logged in as "behat-lay-deputy-102@publicguardian.gov.uk" with password "DigidepsPass1234"
    And I click on "report-start, edit-bank_accounts"
    And I click on "delete" in the "account-03ta" region
    Then the URL should match "/report/\d+/bank-account/\d+/delete"
    And I click on "confirm"
    Then I should not see the "account-03ta" region
