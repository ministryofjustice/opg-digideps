Feature: Visits and Care

@pfa-high-not-started
  Scenario: A user lives with a client that doesn't receive paid care and doesn't have a care plan.
    Given a Lay Deputy has not started a report
    And I view and start the visits and care report section
    When I confirm I live with the client
    And I confirm the client does not receive paid care
    And I provide details on who is doing the caring
    And I confirm the client does not have a care plan
    Then I should see the expected visits and care report section responses
    When I follow link back to report overview page
    Then I should be on the Lay reports overview page
    And I should see "visits-care" as "finished"
