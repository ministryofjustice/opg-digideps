 * This relies on staging tables populated during deputyships CSV ingest, and should only be used in
 * the context of that process.
 *
 * For attaching existing reports, we include reports associated with archived and deleted clients, as these need
 * to be attached to the court order (they are still valid reports for that court order).
 *
 * This uses raw SQL for efficiency, as we'll be processing tens of thousands of rows in the deputyships CSV,
